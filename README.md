# Bio Page with Inter-site Navigation

## Homework assignment for 9/22

## Info:
This assignment was an exercise in bootstrap classes, website navigation, and designing a website with a grid in mind. I started by sketching out on paper a basic layout for the 3 pages of the website. From there, with the help of outlines on my elements, I was able to use bootstrap's rows and columns to match the layout I had originally sketched out

## Some problems faced
I couldn't get my carousel to work for a good amount of time before realizing that I was missing the necessary scripts at the end of my body tags.

In the course of looking for where my code might have been broken, I gained some insight into the necessity of spacing, and indentation in one's code.
